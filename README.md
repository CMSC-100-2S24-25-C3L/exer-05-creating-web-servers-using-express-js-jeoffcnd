When working with a server in JavaScript, grasping GET and POST requests is key for handling client-server communication. A GET request is used to fetch data from the server, while a POST request is used to send data to the server, often for creating or updating resources. In a Node.js environment, frameworks like Express make handling these requests a breeze with app.get() and app.post(). Middleware like express.json() is often needed to parse incoming JSON data in POST requests. And donâ€™t forget to handle request parameters and query strings properly to ensure dynamic and secure data processing. Learning how to manage these requests efficiently is crucial for building RESTful APIs and dynamic web applications.
